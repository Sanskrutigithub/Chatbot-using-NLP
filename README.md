Implementing Chatbot using NLP

This repository implements a simple chatbot using Flask and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages techniques like tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization, and bag-of-words representation to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.

Features:
Intent Recognition: Classifies user messages based on predefined intents (e.g., greetings, questions).
Response Retrieval: Retrieves pre-defined responses based on the classified intent.
Customizable: Can be easily adapted to different domains by modifying training data and response patterns.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Flask
nltk
scikit-learn
Additional libraries may be required for UI development (e.g., Jinja2 for HTML templating)
